üìñ Project Overview
This project addresses the critical gap in understanding how ASR transcription errors propagate through NLP pipelines and affect downstream tasks like topic modeling for African languages. We evaluate multiple ASR systems and topic modeling techniques to quantify this relationship and provide actionable insights for developing more equitable language technologies.

üéØ Research Questions
How accurate are different ASR systems (Whisper, Lelapa AI, fine-tuned wav2vec 2.0) on Setswana podcasts?

How well do topic modeling methods (LDA and BERTopic) work on ASR-generated transcripts?

Is there a measurable correlation between ASR error rates and topic quality?

What specific types of ASR errors cause the most problems for topic modeling?
